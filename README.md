# online-order
A Spring and Hibernate based online ordering system

- Implemented Rest API via Spring MVC including registration, menu searching and ordering, checkout etc.
- Utilized Hibernate to access and operate the data storage (menu, restaurants etc.)
- Provided both authentication and authorization via Spring security to protect the application from malicious attacks.
- Used the Spring framework core technologies to loosely decouple all the components in the application.
- Build the client side with ReactJS and Ant Design to allow users to add items to the shopping cart and place orders.
- Deployed the project to Amazon EC2 for demonstration.
